## Target User Profile
The end user of this profile would be someone interested in hiring a junior software developer with no prior experience in the field but a strong interest in AI and security.

## Information Architecture
For the Information Architecture of this project, I opted for a professional appearance. To achieve this, I divided my curriculum into two distinct sections. The left side represents the personal aspect, while the right side signifies the professional aspect.

## Visual Design
For the personal side, I selected a dark blue color, while I chose white for the professional side. In terms of font style, I used 'Inter' (a sans-serif font) and combined bold and light font weights in order to emphasize different sections.
